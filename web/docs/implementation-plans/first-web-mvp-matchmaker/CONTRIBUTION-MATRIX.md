# Contribution Matrix

| Phase | Readiness | Concrete Features | Key Files | Dependencies | Review Gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PHASE-1 | done | Vite bootstrap, npm scripts, React Router setup, public routes, protected route skeleton, 404 page, app folder structure | `web/package.json`, `web/vite.config.*`, `web/src/main.*`, `web/src/app/router.*`, `web/src/pages/*` | none | app starts, routes resolve, public pages render outside layout |
| PHASE-2 | done | auth types and schemas, mockAuthService, localStorage versioning, email normalization, session restore, AuthProvider, login/register forms, redirect state handling | `web/src/features/auth/*`, `web/src/shared/lib/auth/*`, `web/src/app/providers/*`, `web/src/pages/login/*`, `web/src/pages/register/*` | PHASE-1 | register/login/logout/session restore/deep-link redirect all pass |

## How to Use

- `Readiness` should move from `not started` to `in progress` and then `done`.
- `Concrete Features` should be updated whenever the feature scope changes.
- `Dependencies` should reflect prerequisite phases that must be stable before work starts.
- `Review Gate` should be the acceptance checklist for phase completion.

## Tracking Rules

- Update the matrix whenever a feature is added to, removed from, or reassigned between phases.
- Do not mark a phase done until its exit criteria are verified.
- Keep the matrix synchronized with the phase files and the main plan.
